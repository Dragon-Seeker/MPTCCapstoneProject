# Hangman

Based on the game Hangman, the following code is for the Capstone class final project at [Moraine Park Technical College](https://www.morainepark.edu/). Such was written to use the React framework and MangoDB for the database side of the project.

The main react application is under the root `src` folder of the project while the database backend is within the `backend/src`.
